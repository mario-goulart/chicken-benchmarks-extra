== Module (chicken gc)

This module provides some control over the garbage collector.

=== gc

<procedure>(gc [FLAG])</procedure>

Invokes a garbage-collection and returns the number of free bytes in the heap.
The flag specifies whether a minor ({{#f}}) or major ({{#t}}) GC is to be
triggered. If no argument is given, {{#t}} is assumed. An explicit {{#t}}
argument will cause all pending finalizers to be executed.

=== current-gc-milliseconds

<procedure>(current-gc-milliseconds)</procedure>

Returns the number of milliseconds spent in major garbage collections since
the last call of {{current-gc-milliseconds}} and returns an exact
integer.

=== memory-statistics

<procedure>(memory-statistics)</procedure>

Performs a major garbage collection and returns a three element vector
containing the total heap size in bytes, the number of bytes currently
used and the size of the nursery (the first heap generation). Note
that the actual heap is actually twice the size given in the heap size,
because CHICKEN uses a copying semi-space collector.


=== set-finalizer!

<procedure>(set-finalizer! X PROC)</procedure>

Registers a procedure of one argument {{PROC}}, that will be
called as soon as the non-immediate data object {{X}} is about to
be garbage-collected (with that object as its argument). Note that
the finalizer will '''not''' be called while interrupts are disabled.
This procedure returns {{X}}.

Finalizers are invoked asynchronously, in the thread that happens
to be currently running. Finalizers for data that has become garbage
are called on normal program exit. Finalizers are not run on
abnormal program exit. A normal program exit does not run finalizers
that are still reachable from global data. 

Multiple finalizers can be registered for the same object. The order
in which the finalizers run is undefined. Execution of finalizers
may be nested.


=== force-finalizers

<parameter>(force-finalizers)</parameter>

If true, force and execute all pending finalizers before exiting the
program (either explicitly by {{exit}} or implicitly when the last
toplevel expression has been executed). Default is {{#t}}.


=== set-gc-report!

<procedure>(set-gc-report! FLAG)</procedure>

Print statistics after every GC, depending on {{FLAG}}. A value of
{{#t}} shows statistics after every major GC. A true value different
from {{#t}} shows statistics after every minor GC. {{#f}}
switches statistics off.
